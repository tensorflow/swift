Feel free to sim this section if you already have a good understanding of similar automatic differentiation systems, such as [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax). If you would like a lecture covering these materials, please check out the Fast.AI series (TODO: insert link).\n",

    " - The derivative of $x^2$, which is: $\\frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2x \\frac{d}{dx}$\n",
    " - The derivative of $sin(x)$, which is: $\\frac{d}{dx} \\sin(x) = \\cos(x) \\frac{d}{dx}$\n",
    " - The derivative of $x + x$, which is $\\frac{d}{dx}(x + x) = 2\\frac{d}{dx}$.\n",
    " - The chain rule, which allows composition of differentiable functions: $$\\frac{d}{dx}\\sin(x^2) = \\cos(x^2) \\cdot 2x \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}$$ and in its general form can be written as: $$\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[ f(g(x)) \\right] = f'(g(x))g'(x) \\frac{d}{dx}$$ where $f'$ and $g'$ correspond to the derivatives of functions $f$ and $g$ respectively with respect to their arguments."
