# Swift for TensorFlow (Archived)

Swift for TensorFlow was an experiment in the next-generation platform for machine learning, incorporating the latest research across machine learning, compilers, differentiable programming, systems design, and beyond.  It was archived in February 2021.  Some significant achievements from this project include:

* Added [language-integrated differentiable programming](https://forums.swift.org/t/differentiable-programming-for-gradient-based-machine-learning/42147) into the Swift language.  This work continues in the official Swift compiler. 
* Developed a mutable-value-semantics-oriented [deep learning API](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis).
* Fostered the development of [a model garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models) with more than [30 models from a variety of deep learning disciplines](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models#examples).
* Enabled novel research that [combines deep learning with probabilistic graphical models](https://github.com/borglab/SwiftFusion) for 3D motion tracking and beyond.
* Powered a(n almost) pure-Swift prototype of a [GPU+CPU runtime supporting parallel map](https://github.com/ewconnell/swiftrt).
* Spun off multiple open source side efforts which continue to be under active development:
  * [PythonKit](https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit): Python interoperability with Swift.
  * [swift-jupyter](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter): Enables use of Swift within Jupyter notebooks.
  * [swift-benchmark](https://github.com/google/swift-benchmark): Provides a robust benchmarking suite for Swift code.
* Spun off several other open source efforts:
  * [penguin](https://github.com/saeta/penguin): Parallel programming, data structures, graph algorithms, and more.
  * [Tensors Fitting Perfectly](https://github.com/google-research/swift-tfp): Static analysis of tensor shape mismatches.
* Swift Evolution proposals pitched, implemented, and accepted:
  * [SE-0195](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0195-dynamic-member-lookup.md): User-defined "Dynamic Member Lookup" Types (`@dynamicMemberLookup`)
  * [SE-0216](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0216-dynamic-callable.md): Introduce user-defined dynamically "callable" types (`@dynamicCallable`)
  * [SE-0233](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0233-additive-arithmetic-protocol.md): Make `Numeric` refine a new `AdditiveArithmetic` protocol
  * [SE-0253](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0253-callable.md): Callable values of user-defined nominal types (`func callAsFunction`)

## Getting started

### Using Swift for TensorFlow

- **Google Colaboratory**: The fastest way to get started is to try out Swift
   for TensorFlow right in your browser. Just open up [a tutorial](#tutorials-),
   or start from a [blank notebook][blank_notebook]!
   Read more in our [usage guide](Usage.md).

- **Install locally**: You can [download a pre-built Swift for TensorFlow
   package](Installation.md). After installation, you can follow these
   [step-by-step instructions](Usage.md) to build and execute a Swift script on
   your computer.

- **Run on GCP**: You can spin up a GCE instance using a Swift for TensorFlow
  [Deep Learning VM][dlvm] image, with all drivers and the toolchain
  pre-installed. Instructions can be found in the
  [Installation Guide](Installation.md).

- **Compile from source**: If you'd like to customize Swift for TensorFlow or
   contribute back, follow our [instructions][instructions]
   on building Swift for TensorFlow from source.

## Why Swift for TensorFlow?

Swift for TensorFlow is a new way to develop machine learning models. It
gives you the power of
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) directly integrated into the
[Swift programming language](https://swift.org/about). We believe that
machine learning paradigms are so important that they deserve
**first-class language and compiler support**.

A fundamental primitive in machine learning is gradient-based optimization:
computing function derivatives to optimize parameters. With Swift for
TensorFlow, you can easily differentiate functions using differential
operators like [`gradient(of:)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Functions#/s:10TensorFlow8gradient2of15CotangentVectorQzxcq_xc_tAA14DifferentiableRzSFR_AaFR_AdaFPQy_Rs_r0_lF), or differentiate with respect to an entire
model by calling method [`gradient(in:)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable#/s:10TensorFlow14DifferentiablePAAE8gradient2in15CotangentVectorQzqd__xXE_tSFRd__AaBRd__AfCQyd__Rsd__lF). These differentiation APIs
are not just available for `Tensor`-related concepts‚Äîthey are
generalized for all types that conform to the [`Differentiable`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable)
protocol, including `Float`, `Double`, SIMD vectors, and your own data
structures.

```swift
// Custom differentiable type.
struct Model: Differentiable {
    var w: Float
    var b: Float
    func applied(to input: Float) -> Float {
        return w * input + b
    }
}

// Differentiate using `gradient(at:_:in:)`.
let model = Model(w: 4, b: 3)
let input: Float = 2
let (ùõÅmodel, ùõÅinput) = gradient(at: model, input) { model, input in
    model.applied(to: input)
}

print(ùõÅmodel) // Model.TangentVector(w: 2.0, b: 1.0)
print(ùõÅinput) // 4.0
```

Beyond derivatives, the Swift for TensorFlow project comes with a sophisticated toolchain
to make users more productive. You can run Swift interactively in a Jupyter
notebook, and get helpful autocomplete suggestions to help you explore the
massive API surface of a modern deep learning library. You can [get started
right in your browser in
seconds](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/swift/blob/main/docs/site/tutorials/model_training_walkthrough.ipynb)!

Migrating to Swift for TensorFlow is really easy thanks to Swift's powerful
Python integration. You can incrementally migrate your Python code over (or
continue to use your favorite Python libraries), because you can easily call
your favorite Python library with a familiar syntax:

```swift
import TensorFlow
import Python

let np = Python.import("numpy")

let array = np.arange(100).reshape(10, 10)  // Create a 10x10 numpy array.
let tensor = Tensor<Float>(numpy: array)  // Seamless integration!
```

## Source code

Compiler and standard library development happens on the `main` branch of the
[apple/swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/main) repository.

Additional code repositories that make up the core of the project include:

 - [Deep learning library](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis): high-level
   API familiar to Keras users.

> Swift for TensorFlow is **no longer** a fork of the official Swift language;
> development was previously done on the `tensorflow` branch of the
> [apple/swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/tensorflow) repository.
> Language additions were designed to fit with the direction of Swift and are
> going through the [Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution)
> process.

### Jupyter Notebook support

[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) support for Swift is under development at
[google/swift-jupyter](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter).

### Model garden

[tensorflow/swift-models](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models) is a
repository of machine learning models built with Swift for TensorFlow. It
intended to provide examples of how to use Swift for TensorFlow, to allow for
end-to-end tests of machine learning APIs, and to host model benchmarking
infrastructure.
