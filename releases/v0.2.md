# Swift for TensorFlow (v0.2) Release Notes

## Overview

> Swift for TensorFlow: No boundaries.

This release (v0.2) is the first public release of the Swift for TensorFlow
toolchain, available across Google Colaboratory, Linux and macOS! Our focus has
been on getting the fundamental APIs and basic technology platform in place for
researchers to use. We are looking for intrepid researchers to try it out, and
give us feedback to help shape this next generation machine learning platform.

To learn more, [watch the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s65BigoMV_I)
from the TensorFlow Dev Summit 2019, or step through a
[tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift#tutorials-) in Colab.


## General

This release includes the core Swift for TensorFlow compiler, the standard
libraries, and the [Swift for TensorFlow Deep Learning
Library](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis). Core functionality includes:
the ability to define, train and evaluate models, a notebook environment, and
natural Python interoperability. Feature details and known issues are documented
below.


## Notebook Environments (Colab and Jupyter)


### New Features

* Hit "Tab" to trigger basic semantic autocomplete.
* [Use matplotlib to produce inline graphs.](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter/blob/master/README.md#rich-output)
* Interrupt cell execution by clicking the "stop" button next to the cell.

### Known Issues

* When a runtime error occurs or when you interrupt cell execution, resources (e.g. host memory, GPU memory) do not get released. This can lead to OOMs. ([TF-338](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-338))
    * Workaround: Restart the runtime ("Runtime > Restart Runtime" in the Colab menu bar) to release all the resources.
* If the last statement on a cell evaluates to a struct that was defined in the notebook, then you get an error ("use of undeclared type") instead of seeing the value of the statement. ([TF-125](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-125))
    * Workaround: Wrap the last statement in `print()`.
* Using extensions to conform a type to a protocol (e.g. `extension MyType: MyProtocol { ... }`), often causes duplicate conformance errors. ([TF-162](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-162))
    * Workaround: Go back to the cell where the type is defined, add the conformance to the original declaration, and re-execute the cell.
* If a cell that declares a type executes twice, then it creates two different types with the same name. Mixing these types can lead to confusing error messages like "cannot convert value of type 'MyType' to expected argument type 'MyType'". ([TF-156](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-156))
* The autocomplete UI needs improvement. It should show types and documentation. It should position your cursor in the first argument when you complete a function call.


## Swift Standard Library Enhancements


### New Features

* Declare a
  [`KeyPathIterable`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/KeyPathIterable)
  protocol conformance to make your custom type provide a collection of key
  paths to stored properties. Read [Dynamic Property Iteration using Key
  Paths](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/DynamicPropertyIteration.md)
  for a deep dive into the design.
* Declare an
  [`AdditiveArithmetic`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/KeyPathIterable)
  protocol conformance to make values of your custom type behave like an
  [additive group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_group). If the
  declaration is in the same file as the type definition and when all stored
  properties conform to `AdditiveArithmetic`, the compiler will synthesize the
  conformance automatically.
* Declare an
  [`VectorNumeric`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/KeyPathIterable)
  protocol conformance to make values of your custom type behave like a [vector
  space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space). If the declaration is in
  the same file as the type definition and when all stored properties conform to
  `VectorNumeric` with the same `Scalar` associated type, the compiler will
  synthesize the conformance automatically.

### Known Issues

* The
  [`Differentiable`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable)
  protocol's `allDifferentiableVariables` requirement should not have a setter.
  Do not use this directly through a generic type with a `Differentiable`
  conformance constraint. ([TF-208](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-208))

## Swift for TensorFlow Deep Learning Library

### New Features

* The [`Layer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Layer)
  protocol and [layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Structs/Dense) built on top of it.
* The [`Optimizer`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Optimizer) protocol and [optimizers](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Classes/SGD) built on top of it.
* [Philox](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Structs/PhiloxRandomNumberGenerator) and [Threefry](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Structs/ThreefryRandomNumberGenerator) random number generators and [generic random distributions](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Structs/BetaDistribution).
* Sequential layer application utilities:
  [`sequenced(in:through:_:)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable#/s:10TensorFlow14DifferentiablePAAE9sequenced2in7through_6OutputQyd_0_AA7ContextC_qd__qd_0_t5InputQyd__RszAA5LayerRd__AaMRd_0_AKQyd_0_AGRtd__r0_lF)
  and its n-ary overloads.

### Known Issues

* The `Differentiable` protocol's `allDifferentiableVariables` property requirement should not have a setter. ([TF-208](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-208))
* The majority of the Keras layers remain to be implemented; help wanted! ([#54](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/54))
* There is no built-in API for parameter sharing.
* The [`Parameter`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Classes/Parameter)
  class does not conform to `Differentiable` yet, and is not recommended for
  generial use.
* The compiler errors displayed when a user-defined layer struct fails to fully satisfy the requirements of the `Layer` protocol are unclear.
* There are some ideas for how to reduce the amount of boilerplate required to define layers & models; please join the [swift@tensorflow.org](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/swift) mailing list for the future discussions.

## Automatic Differentiation

### New Features

* Declare a conformance to the
  [`Differentiable`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable)
  protocol to make a custom type work with automatic differentiation. For a
  technical deep dive, read [Differentiable Types](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/DifferentiableTypes.md).
* Use [`differentiableFunction(from:)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Functions#/s:10TensorFlow22differentiableFunction4fromq0_x_q_tcq0_5value_15CotangentVectorQz_AEQy_tAEQy0_c8pullbacktx_q_tc_tAA14DifferentiableRzAaJR_AaJR0_r1_lF) to form a `@differentiable` function from a custom derivative function.
* Custom differentiation APIs are available in the standard library. Follow the
  [custom differentiation
  tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/site/tutorials/custom_differentiation.ipynb)
  to learn how to use them.
  * Gradient checkpointing API: [`withRecomputationInPullbacks(_:)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable#/s:10TensorFlow14DifferentiablePAAE28withRecomputationInPullbacksyqd__qd__xcAaBRd__lF).
  * Gradient surgery API: [`withGradient(_:)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable#/s:10TensorFlow14DifferentiablePAAE12withGradientyxy15CotangentVectorQzzcF).

### Known Issues

* Control flow is not yet supported. ([TF-356](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-356))
* Differentiating functions with respect to an `inout` parameter is not yet supported. ([TF-357](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-357))
* The compiler will only synthesize conformance requirements for
  `Differentiable` in `struct` types. ([TF-37](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-37))
* The `@differentiating` attribute leads to a compiler crash when the derivative
  function is defined in a generic context that is more constrained than the
  original function's generic context. To work around this, use the
  `@differentiable(vjp: ... where ...)` attribute on the original function and specify the
  derivative function after `vjp:` and generic constraints after `where`. ([TF-358](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-358))
* Referring to a `@differentiable` function using key paths leads to a compiler
  crash. ([TF-123](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-123))


## Python Interoperability

### New Features

* Switch between Python versions using [`PythonLibrary.useVersion(_:_:)`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Structs/PythonLibrary#/s:10TensorFlow13PythonLibraryV10useVersionyySi_SiSgtFZ).

### Known Issues

* When the execution of a Python expression raises an exception, the stack trace will not show the Python call stack.
* When an argument to a Python function cannot be converted to a Python object, the compiler wrongly claims that the function is of non-function type rather than pointing out that the argument doesn't conform to `PythonConvertible` ([TF-220](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-220)).
* Python TensorFlow cannot be imported because of binary incompatibility.
