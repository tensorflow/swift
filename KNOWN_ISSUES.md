# Swift for TensorFlow Known Issues

This is a curated list of Swift for TensorFlow known issues and missing
features. With every release, new issues are added and resolved issues are
updated.

Legend:
* Notable issues are marked in **bold**.
* Issues under active development are marked with ðŸš§.

Please see the [JIRA issue tracker](https://bugs.swift.org/projects/TF/issues)
for a full list of known issues.

## Version 0.3

### TensorFlow Library

* [ ] `Tensor` advanced indexing and striding are not supported on GPU.

## Version 0.2

### Notebook Environments (Colab and Jupyter)

* [ ] When a runtime error occurs or when you interrupt cell execution,
      resources (e.g. host memory, GPU memory) do not get released. This can
      lead to OOMs. ([TF-338](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-338))
  * Workaround: Restart the runtime (`Runtime > Restart Runtime` in the Colab
    menu bar) to release all the resources.
* [ ] If the last statement on a cell evaluates to a struct that was defined in
      the notebook, then you get an error ("use of undeclared type") instead of
      seeing the value of the statement.
      ([TF-125](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-125))
  * Workaround: Wrap the last statement in `print()`.
* [ ] Using extensions to conform a type to a protocol (e.g. `extension MyType:
      MyProtocol { ... }`), often causes duplicate conformance errors.
      ([TF-162](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-162))
  * Workaround: Add the conformance in the same cell where the type is defined.
* [ ] If a cell that declares a type executes twice, then it creates two
      different types with the same name. Mixing these types can lead to
      confusing error messages like `cannot convert value of type 'MyType' to
      expected argument type 'MyType'`.
      ([TF-156](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-156))
  * Workaround: Re-run all cells that use the declared type, so that they use the
    new type.
* [ ] The autocomplete UI should show types and documentation. It should
      position your cursor in the first argument when you complete a function
      call.

### Swift Standard Library Enhancements

* [ ] The
      [`Differentiable`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Protocols/Differentiable)
      protocol's `allDifferentiableVariables` requirement should not have a
      setter. Do not use this directly through a generic type with a
      `Differentiable` conformance constraint.
      ([TF-208](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-208))

### TensorFlow Library

* [ ] ðŸš§ **Model checkpointing and serialization APIs are missing.**
      ([TF-388](https://bugs.swift.org/projects/TF/issues/TF-388))
* [ ] **TensorFlow runtime errors (e.g. shape mismatch errors) do not show useful
      source location information or useful stack traces.**
      ([TF-458](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-458))

### Swift for TensorFlow Deep Learning Library

* [ ] Many Keras layers remain to be implemented, help wanted!
      ([swift-apis#54](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-apis/issues/54))
* [ ] Parameter sharing APIs (e.g. using the same `Tensor` weights in multiple
      layers) are missing.
* [ ] The
      [`Parameter`](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/api_docs/Classes/Parameter)
      class does not conform to `Differentiable` yet, and is not recommended for
      general use.
* [ ] The compiler errors displayed when a user-defined layer struct fails to
      fully satisfy the requirements of the `Layer` protocol are unclear.

### Automatic Differentiation

* [ ] ðŸš§ **Differentiation does not yet support functions with control flow.**
      ([TF-356](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-356))
* [ ] ðŸš§ **Higher-order differentiation is not yet supported.**
* [ ] Differentiating functions with respect to an `inout` parameter is not yet
      supported. ([TF-357](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-357))
* [ ] The compiler will only synthesize conformance requirements for
      `Differentiable` in `struct` types.
      ([TF-37](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-37))
* [ ] The `@differentiable` attribute incorrectly passes type-checking in some
      cases, when an error should be produced. This leads to compiler crashes.
      ([TF-449](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-449))
* [x] ~~The `@differentiating` attribute leads to a compiler crash when the
      derivative function is defined in a generic context that is more
      constrained than the original function's generic context.
      ([TF-358](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-358))~~
  * Resolved (v0.3). The `@differentiating` attribute can register derivatives
    with a generic context that is more constrained than the original function's
    generic context.
* [ ] Referring to a `@differentiable` function using key paths leads to a
      compiler crash. ([TF-123](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-123))
* [ ] Python runtime errors do not show useful source location information or
      useful stack traces. ([TF-150](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-150)) 

### Python Interoperability

* [ ] When the execution of a Python expression raises an exception, the stack
      trace will not show the Python call stack.
* [ ] When an argument to a Python function cannot be converted to a Python
      object, the compiler wrongly claims that the function is of non-function
      type rather than pointing out that the argument doesn't conform to
      `PythonConvertible` ([TF-220](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/TF-220)).
* [ ] Python TensorFlow cannot be imported because of various issues (binary
      incompatibility, symbol conflicts).
