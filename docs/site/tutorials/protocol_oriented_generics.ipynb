In Swift, protocols contain multiple abstract members. Classes, structs and enums can conform to multiple protocols and the conformance relationship can be established retroactively. All that enables some designs that aren't easily expressible in Swift using subclassing. We will walk through the idioms that support the use of protocols (extensions and protocol constraints), as well as the limitations of protocols.\n"
