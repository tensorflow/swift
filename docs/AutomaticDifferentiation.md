## Introduction

Automatic Differentiation (AD), also known as algorithmic differentiation, is a
family of techniques used to obtain the derivative of a function. Functions can
be represented as a composition of elementary operators whose derivatives are
well-known. While partial derivatives can be computed through different
techniques, the most common is a recursive application of the chain rule in the
reverse direction, called reverse-mode AD. Reverse-mode AD computes
vector-Jacobian products, i.e. partial derivatives with respect to each input
parameter, and it has become a prerequisite for implementing gradient-based
learning methods. AD has a rich background, here are some great introductions:
[Introduction to Automatic
Differentiation](https://alexey.radul.name/ideas/2013/introduction-to-automatic-differentiation/)
and [Automatic Differentiation in Machine Learning: a
Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05767).

Most AD implementations work on a graph representation of a functional tensor
program, and many have limited expressivity and extensibility. Frameworks based
on a define-by-run programming model (to support dynamic computation graphs)
often lack the ability to perform full-program static analysis and
optimizations, and make it hard to diagnose errors and target hardware
accelerators ahead of time.

The Swift for TensorFlow project aims to provide best-in-class support for AD -
including the best optimizations, best error messages in failure cases, and the
most flexibility and expressivity. To achieve this, we built support for AD
right into the Swift compiler. Additionally, since AD is important to the
broader scientific and numerical computing communities, we decided to build AD
as a generic feature that is completely orthogonal to the TensorFlow support -
the TensorFlow Swift library computes gradients using the AD features of the
Swift language itself.


## Related work

Automatic differentiation has been a research topic in scientific computing and
HPC for nearly half a century. Traditional tools such as
[OpenAD](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/OpenAD/),
[TAPENADE](http://tapenade.inria.fr:8080/tapenade/index.jsp) and
[ADIFOR](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/adifor/) are tools that
transform existing source code. There are many advanced techniques that improved
the performance of derivatives written in FORTRAN, but these tools have not
gained wide adoption in the machine learning community. More recent AD systems
like [Stalin∇](https://github.com/Functional-AutoDiff/STALINGRAD) (pronounced
Stalingrad, available in Scheme),
[DiffSharp](http://diffsharp.github.io/DiffSharp/) (available in F#), and
[ad](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ad) (available in Haskell) achieved
good usability by integrating the differential operator into the language, and
are equipped with a complete set of AD features (such as forward/reverse, nested
AD, Hessians, Jacobians, directional derivatives and checkpointing). They
combine AD closely with functional programming languages.

Researchers in the deep learning community have built many library
implementations of AD in Python and C++, including
[Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd),
[TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org/), [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/), etc. Some
of these libraries are implemented as a transformation on a standalone DSL (a
graph) with a closed set of operators. Others are implemented using operator
overloading directly on a subset of the source language. Although these
libraries have gained wide adoption, the ones that leverage ahead-of-time AD do
not expose an easy-to-use programming model, and the ones that have a friendlier
programming model lack static analysis to perform more optimized AD.

Two recent projects ([Tangent](https://github.com/google/tangent) and
[Myia](https://github.com/mila-udem/myia)) based their AD upon source code
transformation (SCT), a technique that was common in advanced AD systems before
the deep learning era such as
[Stalin∇](https://github.com/Functional-AutoDiff/STALINGRAD). Both tools parse a
Python subset into ASTs and transform a function to its derivatives either in
AST or in a functional IR. These two projects fall into a category in deep
learning tools that was previously underexplored: "ahead-of-time
differentiation" and "model as code", as shown in the following diagram (cite:
[Tangent](https://github.com/google/tangent)). While these tools are pushing the
boundaries of Python, other research projects like
[DLVM](https://dlvm-team.github.io) experimented with SCT AD directly on a
compiler IR that's analogous to the
[Swift Intermediate Language](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/main/docs/SIL.rst)
(SIL).

</p>

The horizontal axis of this diagram may remind people of the trade-offs between
eager execution and graph building: In eager execution, the model is a subset of
user code. In graph mode, the model is a data structure representing some code
in a mini-language. The [Graph Program
Extraction](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/main/docs/GraphProgramExtraction.md)
technique combines the best of both worlds by reducing graphs to an
implementation detail managed by the compiler. The vertical axis in the diagram
adds a second dimension, Automatic Differentiation, where Swift achieves exactly
the same by making AD a core feature of the language and the compiler.

## How reverse-mode AD works

There are two main approaches to automatic differentiation: recording program
execution at runtime and static analysis over the program ahead of time - the
primary difference is interpretation vs. compilation. The define-then-run
approaches are usually implemented as a computation graph transformation that is
analogous to the [source code transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Source_code_transformation_(SCT))
(SCT) technique in the AD literature, and the define-by-run approaches are
usually implemented with [operator overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Operator_overloading_(OO))
(OO).

Given function `f : (T0, T1, ..., Tn) -> U`, reverse-mode AD turns `f` into a
function that computes the partial derivatives with respect to each parameter.
As illustrated below, the new function has two parts: a primal `f_prim` and an
adjoint `f_adj`. `f_prim` computes the original result, while storing primal
intermediate values for `f_adj` to reuse. `f_adj` computes the partial
derivatives of `f` with respect to the parameters.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/AutomaticDifferentiation-ReverseAD.png?raw=true"
       alt="Reverse-mode automatic differentiation."/>
</p>

The data structure used to store these values is called tape, also known as
_[Wengert list](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=355586.364791)_. It is a
data structure consisting of a trace of the program along with intermediate
values. Each right-hand side of an assignment is a primitive operation that has
a corresponding derivative. In compiler terms, Wengert lists are a
fully-unrolled [static single
assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form) (SSA)
form. During execution of the primal, intermediate values generated by the
primal that will be used in the adjoint computation are written to the tape.
When control flow is involved, branch conditions and loop counters are pushed to
the tape as well.

In `f_adj`, the derivatives of each operation in `f_prim` is then called, and
intermediate values are read from the tape in reverse order. When the
accumulation of partial derivatives reaches the parameters, we have obtained the
partial derivatives with respect to the parameters. These values are sometimes
also called the sensitivities of `f`.

Note that `f_adj` has an additional parameter: the seed. A differentiation seed
represents the back-propagated partial derivative. For example, if `f` is called
by `g` and we want to differentiate `g` to get `∇g = ∂g/∂(x0, x1, x2)`, then
`g`'s corresponding adjoint `g_adj` will pass `∂g/∂y` as the seed to `f_adj`, so
that `f_adj` will produce `∇g`. When we want to compute `∇f = ∂f/∂(x0, x1, x2)`,
we simply pass in `∂y/∂y`, i.e. `1`, as the seed.


## Automatic Differentiation in Swift

In this section, we dive deep into the syntax extensions and AD-specific APIs
that allow users to define, use, and customize AD. To do this, we start with the
type system.

### Making arbitrary types support differentiation

We want our AD system to be fully extensible to the point where users can
request the derivatives of a function taking their own user-defined numeric
types, and even use this feature to implement data structure-dependent
algorithms such as tree-recursive neural networks. Therefore, the Swift compiler
makes no assumptions about individual math functions or the types it should
support. We enable library designers and developers to easily define any type to
represent a real vector space or declare functions as being differentiable, all
in pure Swift code.

To achieve this, Swift’s AD system needs to know some key ingredients for a type
to be compatible with differentiation, including:

* The type must represent an arbitrarily ranked vector space (where tensors
  live). Elements of this vector space must be floating point numeric. There is
  an associated scalar type that is also floating point numeric.

* How to initialize an adjoint value for a parameter from a scalar, with the
  same dimensionality as this parameter. This will be used to initialize a zero
  derivative when the parameter does not contribute to the output.

* How to initialize a seed value from a value of the scalar type. This will be
  used to initialize a differentiation seed - usually `1.0`, which represents
  `dy/dy`. Note: the seed type in the adjoint can be an `Optional`, so when
  there is no back-propagated adjoint, the value will be set to `nil`. However
  this will cause performance issues with TensorFlow’s `Tensor` type today
  (optional checks causing send/receive). We need to finish the implementation
  of constant expression analysis to be able to fold away the optional check.

* How values of this type will combine at data flow fan-ins in the adjoint
  computation. By the sum and product rule, this is usually addition. Addition
  is defined on the
  [`Numeric`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/numeric) protocol.

Floating point scalars already have properties above, because of the conformance
to the `FloatingPoint` protocol, which inherits from the `Numeric` protocol.
Similarly, we define a `VectorNumeric` protocol, which declares the four
requirements to represent a vector space.

```swift
public protocol VectorNumeric {
    associatedtype ScalarElement
    associatedtype Dimensionality
    init(_ scalar: ScalarElement)
    init(dimensionality: Dimensionality, repeating repeatedValue: ScalarElement)
    func + (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Self
    func - (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Self
    func * (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Self
}
```

`VectorNumeric` and `Numeric`/`FloatingPoint` are semantically disjoint. We say
that a type supports scalar differentiation when it conforms to
`FloatingPoint`. We say that a type supports **vector differentiation** when it
conforms to `VectorNumeric` while its `ScalarElement` supports **scalar
differentiation** (i.e. conforms to the `FloatingPoint` protocol).

**Note:** According to the standard library, `Numeric` is only suitable for
scalars, not for aggregate mathematical objects like vectors, and so is
`FloatingPoint`. Today we make `VectorNumeric` have duplicate operators, but we
hope to make a case for a more general numeric protocol in the Swift standard
library.

To make a type support differentiation, the user can simply add a conformance to
`FloatingPoint` or `VectorNumeric`. For example, TensorFlow’s `Tensor<Scalar>`
type supports differentiation by conditionally conforming to the `VectorNumeric`
protocol when the associated type `Scalar` conforms to `FloatingPoint`.

```swift
extension Tensor : VectorNumeric where Scalar : Numeric {
    typealias Dimensionality = [Int32] // This is shape.
    typealias ScalarElement = Scalar

    init(_ scalar: ScalarElement) {
        self = Raw.const(scalar)
    }

    init(dimensionality: [Int32], repeating repeatedValue: ScalarElement) {
        self = Raw.fill(dims: Tensor(dimensionality), repeatedValue)
    }

    func + (lhs: Tensor, rhs: Tensor) -> Tensor { ... }
    func - (lhs: Tensor, rhs: Tensor) -> Tensor { ... }
    func * (lhs: Tensor, rhs: Tensor) -> Tensor { ... }
}
```

Since `VectorNumeric` is general enough to provide all necessary ingredients for
differentiation and the compiler doesn’t make special assumptions about
well-known types, users can make any type support automatic differentiation. The
following example shows a generic tree structure `Tree<Value>`, written as an
algebraic data type, conditionally conforming to `VectorNumeric` by recursively
defining operations using pattern matching. Now, functions over `Tree<Value>`
can be differentiated!

```swift
indirect enum Tree<Value> {
    case leaf(Value)
    case node(Tree, Value, Tree)
}

extension Tree : VectorNumeric where Value : VectorNumeric {
    typealias ScalarElement = Value.ScalarElement
    typealias Dimensionality = Value.Dimensionality
  
    init(_ scalar: ScalarElement) {
        self = .leaf(Value(scalar))
    }
  
    init(dimensionality: Dimensionality, repeating repeatedValue: ScalarElement) {
        self = .leaf(Value(dimensionality: dimensionality, repeating: repeatedValue))
    }
  
    static func + (lhs: Tree, rhs: Tree) -> Tree {
        switch (lhs, rhs) {
        case let (.leaf(x), .leaf(y)):
            return .leaf(x + y)
        case let (.leaf(x), .node(l, y, r)):
            return .node(l, x + y, r)
        case let (.node(l, x, r), .leaf(y)):
            return .node(l, x + y, r)
        case let (.node(l0, x, r0), .node(l1, y, r1)):
            return .node(l0 + l0, x + y, r0 + r1)
        }
    }
  
    static func - (lhs: Tree, rhs: Tree) -> Tree { ... }
    static func * (lhs: Tree, rhs: Tree) -> Tree { ... }
    static func / (lhs: Tree, rhs: Tree) -> Tree { ... }
}
```

### When is a function differentiable?

Once we have types that support differentiation, we can then define arbitrary
functions over these types. Because we are aiming for an open and extensible
system, we made the compiler agnostic of the actual operations - it does not
have special knowledge of numeric standard library functions or distinguish
between primitive operators and other functions. We recursively determine a
function's differentiability based on:

*   its type signature: whether inputs and the output support scalar
    differentiation or vector differentiation
*   its visibility: if the function body is not visible by the Swift compiler
    (e.g. a C function or an argument which is a closure), then it is not
    differentiable
*   its data flow: whether all instructions and function calls are
    differentiable along the data flow to be differentiated

Since the rule is recursively defined, it needs a base case, so that the
compiler will stop looking into function calls and determine the
differentiability. Functions representing such base cases are often referred to
in AD as "primitives". For that, we introduce the `@differentiable` attribute.
Users can use `@differentiable` to give any function _guaranteed
differentiability_. The attribute has a few associated arguments:

*   the differentiation mode (currently only `reverse` is supported)
*   the primal (optional, and should be specified if the adjoint requires checkpoints)
*   the adjoint

For example, one can define the derivative of `tanh` and make the AD system
treat it as a "primitive", which is a base case when determining
differentiability.


```swift
// Differentiable with respect to all parameters using reverse-mode AD.
// The corresponding adjoint is `dTanh`.
@differentiable(reverse, adjoint: dTanh)
func tanh(_ x: Float) -> Float {
    ... some super low-level assembly tanh implementation ...
}
// d/dx tanh(x) = 1 - (tanh(x))^2
//
// Here, y is the original result of tanh(x), and x is the input parameter of the
// original function. We don't need to use `x` in tanh's adjoint because we already
// have access to the original result.
func dTanh(x: Float, y: Float, seed: Float) -> Float {
    return (1.0 - y * y) * seed
}
```


As the user would expect, in order to exclude functions that have parameters
that cannot be differentiated with respect to, `@differentiable` can explicitly
set parameters using `withRespectTo:`. Also, `self` can be set as a
differentiation parameter, because `self` may be a numeric type - math
operations in both the Swift standard library and the TensorFlow library are
defined as instance methods, e.g. `FloatingPoint.squareRoot()` and
`Tensor.convolved(withFilter:strides:padding:)`.


```swift
extension Tensor {
    // Differentiable with respect to `self` (the input) and the first parameter
    // (the filter) using reverse-mode AD. The corresponding adjoint is `dConv`.
    @differentiable(reverse, withRespectTo: (self, .0), adjoint: dConv)
    func convolved(withFilter k: Tensor, strides: [Int32], padding: Padding) -> Tensor {
        return #tfop("Conv2D", ...)
    }

    func dConv(k: Tensor, strides: [Int32], padding: Padding,
               y: Tensor, seed: Tensor) -> Tensor {
        ...
    }
}
```



### Using automatic differentiation

We currently support two differential operators: `#gradient()` and
`#valueAndGradient()`. The former takes a function and returns a function
that computes partial derivatives. The latter takes a function and returns a
function that computes both the original value and the vector-Jacobian products.
A trivial example is shown as follows:


```swift
@differentiable(reverse, adjoint: dTanh)
func tanh(_ x: Float) -> Float {
    ... some super low-level assembly tanh implementation ...
}

func dTanh(x: Float, y: Float, seed: Float) -> Float {
    return (1.0 - (y * y)) * seed
}

func foo(_ x: Float, _ y: Float) -> Float {
    return tanh(x) + tanh(y)
}

// Get the gradient function of tanh.
let dtanh_dx = #gradient(tanh)
dtanh_dx(2)

// Get the gradient function of foo with respect to the first parameter.
let dfoo_dx = #gradient(foo, withRespectTo: .0)
dfoo_dx(3, 4)
```


Note that implementation of `#gradient(foo, withRespectTo: .0)` is still in progress.


## Automatic Differentiation in the Swift compiler

Automatic differentiation in Swift is a compiler transform implemented as a
static analysis. AD benefits from being implemented on a functional IR like SSA
form, so our implementation is a transformation on the Swift Intermediate
Language. [The differentiation
pass](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/tensorflow/lib/SILOptimizer/Mandatory/TFDifferentiation.cpp)
is part of the mandatory lowering pass pipeline, and is run before [Graph
Program Extraction](GraphProgramExtraction.md).

When differentiating a function in reverse mode, the compiler produces separate
functions that contain the corresponding "primal code" and "adjoint code", which
in turn compute the vector-Jacobian products of the computation.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/AutomaticDifferentiation-Compiler.png?raw=true"
       alt="Automatic differentiation compiler transform."/>
</p>

When the `#gradient()` operator is applied on a function `f : (T0, T1, ...,
Tn) -> U`, the compiler checks whether a `@differentiable` attribute exists on
this function. If it does, then the compiler generates a direct call to this
declared adjoint, passing in the original input parameters, the original result
and the seed. Otherwise, the compiler digs into the function and tries to
differentiate instructions and function calls within it. In this process, the
compiler generates:

- A struct type `C_f`, whose members include primal intermediate values as
  stored properties and strongly-typed tapes (only if there's any control flow
  or loops). We call this struct "checkpoints" for implementation modeling
  purposes.
- A primal function `f_prim : (T0, T1, ..., Tn) -> (C_f, U)` that
  returns primal checkpoints and the original result.
- An adjoint function `f_adj : (T0, T1, ..., Tn, C_f, U, U) -> (T0, T1, ...,
Tn)` that takes primal checkpoints, the original result, and a seed and returns
the vector-Jacobian products.
- A "canonical gradient" (a seedable, result-preserving differentiated function)
  `f_can_grad : (T0, T1, ..., Tn, U) -> (U, T0, T1, ..., Tn)` which internally
  calls `f_prim` and uses the primal's returns to call `f_adj`. The last
  parameter of this function takes a differentiation seed. This function returns
  the original result and the vector-Jacobian products.
- A finalized gradient function `∇f : (T0, T1, ..., Tn) -> (T0, T1, ..., Tn)`
  which internally calls `f_can_grad` using a default seed `1` and throws away
  the first result (the first result would be used if `#valueAndGradient()`
  was the differential operator).

More than one function exists to wrap the canonical gradient function
`f_can_grad`, because we'll support a variety of AD configurations, e.g.
`#gradient()` and `#valueAndGradient()`. We expect the finalized gradient
function `∇f` to be inlined and have other normal optimization passes applied,
to expose primal-adjoint data flow and eliminate dead code.

AD in Swift involves changes to the syntax, the type checker, the standard
library, the SIL instruction set, the compiler pass pipeline, and even the
runtime (for tape operations). The detailed implementation is out of scope for
this whitepaper. As an overview, currently we have the infrastructure and the
overall workflow implemented, but code synthesis within primal generation and
adjoint generation, including control flow graph canonicalization, loop counter
insertion and tape management, are still a work in progress. This means that
today's differential operators work only when there's a `@differentiable`
attribute specifying the adjoint (or both the primal and the adjoint).
Completing the AD implementation is our immediate priority.

# Future directions

### Better syntax

AD is an unconventional feature in a general-purpose programming language like
Swift. In order to allow users to specify what formal parameter to differentiate
with respect to and make it work well with the type checker, we use the
`#`-literal syntax that takes parameter indices or `self`, and which is parsed
into a distinct expression in the Swift AST. However, we would prefer to define
differential operators as regular generic functions.


### Flow-sensitive differential operators

As described in the document, we initially provide two differential operators on
functions: `#gradient` and `#valueAndGradient`. Differentiating functions, 
however, do not provide a similar developer experience as

```swift
let y = log(x)
#gradient(y, wrt: x)
```

... in which `#gradient` is effectively a flow-sensitive differential operator.
However, from a technical standpoint, function-to-function transformation that
we initially develop is the foundation even for flow-sensitive differentiation. 
Once the foundation is done, syntactic features on top such as this one will be
considered and implemented to enable more expressive user code.


### Inline adjoint definition

When defining a custom adjoint for a function, today we use the attribute 
`@differentiable(reverse, adjoint: someAdjointFunction)` where 
`someAdjointFunction` is defined out-of-line. However, there are a few problems:
1) adjoints are never directly called by the user, so it does not make sense to
require the user to define such a function with a standalone function name,
2) out-of-line definition of adjoints also makes it hard for user to customize 
checkpointing in the original computation, and 3) `@differentiable` uses confusing 
indices to refer to parameters to differentiate with respect to. To address these
issues, a possible solution would be to introduce an inline syntax with keywords
`adjoint` and `wrt`:

```swift
func foo(_ a: Float, _ b: String) -> Float {
   let x = ... a ...
   let y = ...
   return y
   
   adjoint let seed wrt a, b { // `seed` is the backpropagated value.
     return ... x ... * seed
     //         ^ 
     // The primal value `x` falls out of lexical scoping, and will be checkpointed.
   }
}
```

### Differentiating opaque closures and dynamic method dispatch

Statically differentiating a function requires the body of the function to be
visible to the compiler. However, this limits the expressiveness of differential
operators. For example, users can't apply `#gradient` to a function argument
that has a function type because the compiler can't always see into the body of
the original function.

```swift
func foo(_ f: (Float) -> Float) -> Float {
    return #gradient(f)(0)
}
```

```console
test.swift:2:22: error: cannot differentiate an opaque closure
    return #gradient(f)(0)
           ~~~~~~~~~~^~
test.swift:1:12: note: value defined here
func foo(_ f: (Float) -> Float) -> Float {
           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```


One potential solution is to introduce a new function calling convention 
`@convention(differentiable)`, which causes function references to carry their
primal and adjoint function pointers with them. This enables the compiler to
directly call the primal and the adjoint, without the need to see into the 
function declaration.

### Differentiating with respect to properties

Real-world models are often written as a `struct` type that declares parameters,
but differentiation parameters in the `#gradient` expression syntax currently
only support parameter indices or `self`. When the prediction function is
defined as an instance method on the type, how can we express "differentiate
`prediction(for:)` with respect to all parameters"?

One possibility is to leverage program synthesis to generate an aggregate type
representing all parameters in a model type, and make the differential operator
`#gradient` return such an aggregate value. We have begun experimenting with
this approach but need to develop the ideas further.


### Derivative surgery

Some machine learning models require manipulating the gradient with respect to 
certain values, e.g. gradient clipping. [Tangent](https://github.com/google/tangent) 
provides such a feature as a syntax extension in Python. We are interested in 
figuring out the best programming model to express derivative surgery, for example:
introducing a compiler-known `replaceGradient(of:_:)` API.

```swift
func prediction(for input: Tensor<Float>, parameters: Tensor<Float>) -> Float {
    var prediction = input
    for _ in 0...5 {
        // Gradient clipping.
        replaceGradient(of: prediction) { dPred in
            max(min(dPred, 1), -1)
        }
        prediction = lstm.prediction(for: input, parameters)
    }
    return prediction
}
```


### Checkpointing

One commonly requested feature for ML training is the ability to trade off
computation for lower memory consumption, since the backward pass preserves
checkpoints from the primal computation to prevent recomputation in the adjoint
computation. Selectively discarding and rematerializing primal values is a
common technique called checkpointing. There have been decades of research
contributions such as [binomial
checkpointing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06799.pdf). We would like to
incorporate these techniques directly into our model.


### Higher-order differentiation

[Perturbation confusion and sensitivity
confusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4892) are two common bugs in nested uses
of the differential operator using SCT techniques, and require user attention to
correctly resolve. The application of rank-2 polymorphism in the
[ad](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ad) package in Haskell defined away
sensitivity confusion, but Swift’s type system does not support that today. In
order to support higher-order differentiation with sound semantics and predictable
behavior in Swift, we need to teach the compiler to carefully emit diagnostics and
reject malformed cases.


### Forward mode

Our existing AD infrastructure has pre-allocated space for forward-mode AD, e.g.
the first parameter to the `@differentiable` attribute. Although it's not a
commonly requested feature, it will enable efficient computation of
Hessian-vector products for research in optimization methods. It is also easier
to implement than reverse-mode AD and may enable further engineering
explorations in mixing forward and reverse.
